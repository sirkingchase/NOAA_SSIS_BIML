# NOAA_SSIS_BIML
BIML is a markup langauge for automating the creation of SSIS ETL Packages.  This POC was put together for a lunch-n-learn I presented. 
The BIML scripts creates ETL jobs that pull data from NOAA Buoys such as wave height per minute, dominate wave period, water temp, salinity, etc.
Included are database scripts for creating the MS SQL Databases for storing the data, BIML scripts, complete SSIS packages and a powerpoint presentation with example use cases.
