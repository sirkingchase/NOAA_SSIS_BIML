# NOAA_SSIS_BIML
BIML is a markup langauge for automating the creation of SSIS ETL Packages.  This POC was put together for a lunch-n-learn and it creates ETL jobs that pull data from NOAA Buoys.  
Included are database scripts for creating the MS SQL Databases for storing the data, BIML scripts, complete SSIS packages and a powerpoint presentation with example use cases.
